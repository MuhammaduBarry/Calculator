<!-- # 1. we want to store our result value  -->
<!-- # 2. we want to take our value and store it in our left number -->
<!-- # 3. we listen for our operator event  -->
<!-- # 4. take our left operand event and  -->
# 5. calculate our new result on equal to event
# 6. repeat the process our operator then listen for our right operand
# 7. we repeat the result cycle to give us a new result
